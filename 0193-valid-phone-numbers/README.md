<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-phone-numbers/">193. Valid Phone Numbers</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><p>Given a text file <code>file.txt</code> that contains a list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one-liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.</p>

<pre>
987-123-4567
123 456 7890
(123) 456-7890
